# 🚀 Action Items to Fix Production Deployment

## Issue Fixed
✅ Profile button not showing in production
✅ S3 buckets and DynamoDB data not loading
✅ Authentication working locally but failing on Vercel

## What Was Wrong
The frontend was trying to read **httpOnly cookies** directly with JavaScript, which doesn't work. HttpOnly cookies can only be accessed server-side.

## What Was Fixed
The frontend now calls the `/auth/me` endpoint to get user information, which has server-side access to the httpOnly cookies.

## 📋 Action Items for You

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: Set Environment Variables in Vercel

**You must add these environment variables in Vercel before the app will work:**

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables

2. Add these two variables:

   **Variable 1:**
   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_DRIVE_API_BASE_URL
   Value: https://brmh.in
   Apply to: ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development
   ```

   **Variable 2:**
   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
   Value: https://brmh.in
   Apply to: ✓ Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development
   ```

3. **Click "Save"**

4. **Redeploy:**
   - Go to: Deployments → Latest Deployment
   - Click the three dots (•••)
   - Click "Redeploy"
   - ✅ Check "Use existing Build Cache" (faster)
   - Click "Redeploy"

---

## ✅ Verification Steps

### Step 1: Wait for Deployment
- Wait for Vercel to finish redeploying (usually 1-2 minutes)
- Check that deployment status is "Ready"

### Step 2: Clear Browser Cache
```
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Right-click the refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
OR
1. DevTools → Application → Storage
2. Click "Clear site data"
```

### Step 3: Test Login
```
1. Visit https://drive.brmh.in
2. You should be redirected to https://auth.brmh.in/login
3. Login with your credentials
4. After login, you should be redirected back
5. ✅ Profile button should appear in the top-right corner
```

### Step 4: Use Debug Page
```
1. Visit https://drive.brmh.in/debug-cookies
2. Click "Fetch User Info"
3. ✅ Should see your user data (email, name, etc.)
```

### Step 5: Test Drive Features
```
1. Check if folders/files are loading
2. Try uploading a file
3. Check if S3 buckets are accessible
4. ✅ Everything should work like localhost
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Profile Button Still Not Showing

**Cause:** Environment variables not set or deployment didn't pick them up

**Fix:**
1. Verify variables are in Vercel Settings → Environment Variables
2. Redeploy again (make sure to use the new build)
3. Clear browser cache completely

### ❌ "Fetch User Info" Fails on Debug Page

**Cause:** Backend cookies not being sent

**Possible fixes:**
1. Make sure you logged in via https://auth.brmh.in first
2. Check backend logs for cookie setting messages
3. Verify backend is running at https://brmh.in
4. Check browser console for CORS errors

### ❌ Still Getting 401 Errors

**Cause:** Cookies not shared across subdomains

**Fix:**
Check backend logs for:
```
[Auth] Setting cookies with options: { domain: '.brmh.in', secure: true, sameSite: 'none' }
```
If you don't see this, the backend cookie configuration needs updating.

## 📁 Files Changed (For Your Reference)

### Modified Files:
1. `lib/sso-utils.ts` - Added async user fetching via /auth/me
2. `lib/auth-context.tsx` - Uses new async method
3. `.env` - Added NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL
4. `env.example` - Documented both variables

### New Files:
1. `app/debug-cookies/page.tsx` - Debug page at /debug-cookies
2. `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_FIX.md` - Detailed technical documentation
3. `DEPLOYMENT_ACTION_ITEMS.md` - This file

### No Changes Needed:
- Backend is already configured correctly
- Middleware already handles httpOnly cookies
- API client already sends credentials

---

## 🎯 Success Criteria

When everything is working, you should see:

1. ✅ Profile button with your avatar in top-right corner
2. ✅ Dropdown menu when clicking profile (Profile, Settings, Logout)
3. ✅ Folders and files loading
4. ✅ S3 buckets accessible
5. ✅ DynamoDB data fetching
6. ✅ No 401 errors in console
7. ✅ No cookie warnings in console
8. ✅ Debug page shows user info successfully

---

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Set environment variables in Vercel** (5 minutes)
2. **Redeploy** (2 minutes)
3. **Clear browser cache** (30 seconds)
4. **Test login** (1 minute)
5. **Verify with debug page** (1 minute)

Total time: ~10 minutes

---

## 🆘 If Nothing Works

If you've followed all steps and it still doesn't work:

1. Check the debug page output
2. Share any console errors
3. Check backend logs for cookie setting
4. Verify domain is exactly `.brmh.in` (with the dot)
5. Confirm HTTPS is being used (not HTTP)

The most common issue is forgetting to redeploy after setting environment variables!
