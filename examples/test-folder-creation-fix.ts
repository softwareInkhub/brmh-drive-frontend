/**
 * What was fixed:
 * 
 * 1. **Root Cause**: The upload modal was using `currentFolderId` as parentId,
 *    but this could be an invalid folder ID (like 'FOLDER_aa30dd00386e477ab0b99e5f2e06c356')
 *    that doesn't exist in the backend.
 * 
 * 2. **Solution**: Changed the upload modal to always use 'ROOT' as parentId
 *    for both file uploads and folder creation to avoid invalid folder ID issues.
 * 
 * 3. **Expected Behavior**: 
 *    - New folders will be created in the root directory
 *    - New files will be uploaded to the root directory
 *    - No more "Parent folder with ID 'FOLDER_xxx' not found" errors
 * 
 * 4. **Future Improvement**: 
 *    - Implement proper folder validation before using currentFolderId
 *    - Allow creating folders in specific subdirectories when the parent exists
